This mod enables base raiding with a breachingcharge, which can be used to destroy fences and gates, as well as other walls and objects from mods such as BBP, Simple Base, More Doors and Expansion.

In order to make it fully compatible with the Expansion mod you will need this [compatiblity mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2158553597).

If you are using the codelock mod you will also need this [compatibility mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2464098674).
